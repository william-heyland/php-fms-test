My initial observations of the 3 interfaces
===========================================
a) The FileSystem interface provides methods for creating, updating, and deleting Files and Folders.
The FileSystem interface thus dictates that it shall handle all interactions with my chosen storage engine.

b) The design of the File and Folder interfaces provide a simple "datatype role" with no direct database interaction.
The File and Folder interfaces can and should however handle all input validation where possible.

c) The File interface defines the relationship between the file and it's parent Folder Object.

d) However, the Folder interface does not provide any such relationship with it's own parent folder.
The Folder interface does however allow the path to be set. The path will thus be used to define the location of the folder and it's parent.

My plan
=======
1) I will be using the MySQL database storage engine for this project.

2) I will create a separate database interface for my storage engine implementation.

3) I will "normalise" the File and Folder data with the addition of file_id, folder_id, and parent_folder_id fields.
The external API will remain unchanged.
The addition of parent_folder_id will enforce the relationship of the data and help ensure data integrity in case of programming errors.
Note: Under normal circumstances I would discuss this with you first, but since it's now the weekend and this is a TEST project, I hope this is OK.

Observations
============
a) The File and Folder interfaces specify a time parameter type of DateTime yet do not enforce this in the method declaration.
I have added the 'DateTime' datatype specification.

Progress
========
1) Progress is going well, I have completed a lot of the "back-end" functionality.
I need to further test and review the code I have written and check for errors.

2) I have added 2 new Database interfaces files and implemented a basic mysql database storage framework.

3) I still need to write data input validation code for the File and Folder classes.

4) If necessary, I need to decide on an interactive "front-end" to the filesystem (check with Richard?)

Progress
========
1) Input validation is complete

2) I have further tested and verified that all the File, Folder, and FileSystem methods are working as intended

3) I am ready to decide on an inteface?
